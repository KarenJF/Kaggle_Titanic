# Machine Leanring Project 1: Titanic 
# First Machine Learning project

Note: This is the famious machine learning project in Kaggle. Data is from Kaggle competition. 

Project Background: 
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. 

Goal: 
In this project, I'm going to use machine learning method to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
